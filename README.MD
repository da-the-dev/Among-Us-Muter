# About
This is a bot that solves the voice chat spam problem when playing Among Us with friends on a Discord server.   
Have someone who doesn't mute himself/herself when the game started? Someone forgets to un-mute themselves? With Among Us Muter this is no longer an issue! It mutes and un-mute everybody in the voicechannel to stop player from accidentally spoiling if they're Imposter or if someone is. It is very simple to use and set up.

# Step-by-step setup guide

* #### **Step 1:** Look at your server's categories
    After you add you add AUM to your server make sure that there's a new category called "AMONG US ROOMS". This is where all of the voice channels for AUM are going to be created.
* #### **Step 2:** `$createRoom`
    To create a room to play Among Us and use AUM, type `$createRoom <name>`, replacing `<name>` with your desired room name. The voicechannel with the same name will be created in "AMONG US ROOMS" shortly.
* #### **Step 3:** Join the room
    Once you've joined the room, you will recieve 2 roles: 'AUM Muter Role' and 'TAG: Unmuted'. Don't worry about the second role, it is used by the bot. You just have to make sure you have these roles.
* #### **Step 4:** Bring your friends in the same voicechannel and when the game started type `$amg`
    Now, to mute the room, type `$amg` in any text channel. To un-mute the room, type `$amg` again. The lobby will be un-muted.
* #### **Step 5:** Play!
    Just and play enjoy Among Us!
* #### **Step 6:** When you're done
    Once you're done playing, just leave the voicechannel. It will delete itself after about a half a minute.
