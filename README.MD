# About
This is a bot that solves the voice chat spam problem when playing Among Us with friends on a Discord server.   
Have someone who doesn't mute himself/herself when the game started? Someone forgets to un-mute themselves? With Among Us Muter this is no longer an issue! It mutes and un-mute everybody in the voicechannel to stop player from accidentally spoiling if they're Imposter or if someone is. It is very simple to use and set up.
