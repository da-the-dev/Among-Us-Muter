# Among Us Muter
## About
This is a bot that solves the voice chat spam problem when playing Among Us with friends on a Discord server.   
Have someone who doesn't mute himself/herself when the game started? Someone forgets to un-mute themselves? With Among Us Muter this is no longer an issue! It mutes and un-mute everybody in the voicechannel to stop player from accidentally spoiling if they're Imposter or if someone is. It is very simple to use and set up.
## How to set up
Check out [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4IwTTkcpc8) video for instruction on how to set it up and use it.

Once you have executed all previous commands, you can use `$amg`. To mute previously specified voicechannel, type `$amg`. You need to have Administrator permission or have mute role. To un-mute previously specified voicechannel, simply type `$amg` again. Channel will be un-muted shortly.
